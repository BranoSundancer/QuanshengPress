# QuanshengPress

Quansheng UV-K5 keypress automation interface

## Intro

The objective of this project is to automate the operation of Quansheng UV-K5 (handheld transceiver), especially frequency changes using rigctl interface controlled by [Gpredict](https://github.com/csete/gpredict). **It requires firmware modification** [Quansheng Dock FW](https://github.com/nicsure/quansheng-dock-fw) and leverages it's (virtual) keypress emulation.

The code is in development phase. Basic usage you will find when you run the script without any parameter. This README will be updated when [minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) is ready. It will be also announced in Facebook group [Quansheng Dock/Xvfo UV- K5/K6/5R+](https://www.facebook.com/groups/289656334131909).
